**Introduction**
--------------------

F5® BIG-IP® Cloud EditionTM was built to help network operations teams and applications teams collaborate more effectively in the rapid delivery of secure, appropriately supported applications. BIG-IP Cloud Edition simplifies and centralizes core device and app services management functions like setup, licensing, upgrades, analytics, and scaling. Operations teams can easily define a self-service catalog of application services that developers can then access, on demand, via a dashboard or API call. These services are defined, updated, and deployed for each application in contrast to the traditional, consolidated model in which a single Application Delivery Controller (ADC) supports multiple applications.

Customers can use BIG-IQ Centralized Management to create Auuto-Scaling BIG-IP VE devices in AWS cloud with service scaling group (SSG) which dynamically and autimatically delete or deploy BIG-IP VE devices as needed.

**The BIG­-IP Cloud Edition Architecture**
---------------------------
**Infrastructure Components**

1) BIG-IP Per-App virtual editions (VEs), each dedicated to a single application.

2) F5 BIG-IQ® Centralized Management which provides management, visibility, and licensing services across all instances—no matter where they are located.

**Logical Components**

1) Cloud providers - BIG-IP Cloud Edition supports deployment and auto scale of BIG-IP instances on the following cloud platforms:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
 
* VMware vCenter-based private clouds

2) Device templates - Device templates define all infrastructure-level characteristics (time zone, DNS, hostname, accounts, NTP, licensing, networking, etc.) that are required to deploy a BIG-IP device.

3) Service scaling groups (SSG) - When application services are deployed from an application template and a service scaling group is selected as the target, BIG-IP Cloud Edition manages the availability and elastic scaling of resources to deliver the services, plus manages the lifecycle and upgrade process for the BIG-IP devices delivering those services.

4) Application templates - Application templates define the application delivery and security services that will be deployed for an application, including all BIG-IP objects such as virtual servers, profiles, monitors, SSL certificates, security policies, etc.

**Deployment Process**

To start auto-scaling BIG-IP VE devices for application in AWS, you need to complete these procedures.

* Step 1. Set up AWS environment

* Step 2. Create device template for BIG-IP VE

* Step 3. Add cloud and environment to BIG-IQ

* Step 4. Create a service scaling group

* Step 5. Create service template

* Step 6. Addign permissions to users (option)

* Step 7. Create and deploy an application


**Deploy BIG-IP Cloud Edition in AWS**
----------------------------------------------
Customers can deploy BIG-IP Cloud Edition from scratch in AWS through subscribing F5 software appliances on AWS marketplace or use BIG-IP Cloud Edition Trial Quick Start which is an AWS CloudFormation Template (CFT) created by F5 to allow customers to experience the solution in an automation way. 
In order to reduce human errors and minimize the time to deploy, we will use CloudFormation template as example to explain each step in the later chatper. 


**BIG-IP Cloud Edition Trial Quick Start**

To deploy the BIG-IP Cloud Edition Trial Quick Start in AWS, check the link below.
<https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-big-ip-cloud-edition-trial-quick-start>

This CloudFormation Template (CFT) creates two BIG-IQ VE instances: a BIG-IQ CM instance to configure and orchestrate instances of BIG-IP VE, and a BIG-IQ Data Collection Device (DCD) to store analytics data. The CFT also creates an Apache demo web server.
Enter the service page of CloudFormation and verify the bigiqCmUrl showed on the Outputs tab.

SSH to BIG-IQ VE instance and create an admin user password for web access.

	1. Type "modify auth password admin"
	2. Type new password
	3. Confirm new password
	4. Type "save sys config"

**Configuration**
--------------------------------------

**Step 1. Set up AWS environment**

The full access permissions you need to be granted are Auto Scale Groups, Instances, SQS, S3, CloudWatch, and CloudFormation. Additionally, you need list, create, and delete permissions for the IAM role/rolePolicy/InstanceProfile.

1) VPC Configurations

* Create VPC with 2 subnets in different AZs and unique CIDR
* Create Internet gateway and attach it to VPC
* Create route table for each subnet with default route
	
2) Create a key pair to allow SSH access

3) Create a security group to protect the elastic load balancer

4) Create a classic elastic load balancer (ELB) as tier1 service scaler to distribute requests from Internet to BIG-IP VE of SSG.

	1. ELB Type: Classic Load Balancer
	2. Health Checks: 
       * Ping protocol:TCP
       * Ping port: 22
       * Timeout: 5 seconds
       * Interval: 30 seconds
	3. EC2 Instances: Enabled Cross-Zone Load Balancing and Connection Draining at 300 seconds.
	4. Edit the ELB listeners to remove the default listener (Load Balancer Protocol and Instance Protocol of HTTP on port 80).

**Step 2. Create device template for BIG-IP VE**

1) At BIG-IQ page, click **Devices** then, on the left, click **DEVICE TEMPLATES**.

2) Click **Create** button.

3) Name the template, click **Add/Remove** button and select AWS as "Provider Type".

![Deployment Diagram](images/device-template.jpg)

4) Leave the **Configuration** as blank and **User Account** as default value, configure **DNS&NTP** with apporpriate value.

**Step 5. Create service template** 

1) Click **Applications** > **SERVICE CATALOG** > clone default template **Default-AWS-f5-HTTPS-WAF-lb-template**

2) Name your service template

3) Click service template name you just created

4) Keep **PROPERTIES** as default, you can configure each object under **LOCAL TRAFFIC**. We will configure **Virtual Servers** to demostrate how service template works.

5) Click **Virtual Servers** > click the name of virtial server template (ex: Demo-AWS-HTTPS-WAF-LTM_default_vs).

_Note: A Service Template is a baseline for creating a new application. This allows you to maintain a consistent environment. Parameters that you define as editable are visible and can be revised. Using that template, and without having a lot of network expertise, the application manager can deploy the application objects you want by simply specifying a few key values._

6) Check **Editable** box in the right hand side of **Description** and **State(on BIG-IQ)**. Click the **Preview** in the upper right corner to see what the user interface look like when someone uses this template to deploy an application. You can also configure **Pools**, **Nodes**, etc. but we will keep it as default.

![Deployment Diagram](images/vs-preview.jpg)

**Step 6. Addign permissions to users (option)**

1) Click **System** > **USER MANAGEMENT** > **Users**, click **Add** button.

2) Select **Auth Provider** as local, type **User name**, **Full Name**, **Password** and **Confirm Password**. Click **Save&Close**.

3) Click **ROLE MANAGEMENT** > **Roles** > **CUSTOM ROLES** > **Application Roles** > **Add**

4) Type **Name** and **Description**, select the user you want to join to this role. Select **Templates** and **Service Scaling Group** you want this role access to.

5) Click **Save&Close**
